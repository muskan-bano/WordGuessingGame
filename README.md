# WordFinder
A simple word guessing game developed as part of our 2nd year Dilpoma Minor Project
The game is coded using JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS. Each number of each level has a different word stored in it and their corresponding hint. A player must enter a number to start guessing. All letters should be guessed in capital letters and at a time only a single letter can be guessed.
