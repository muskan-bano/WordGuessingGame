WordFinder is a classic word guessing game inspired by common classroom break-time games such as FOOL, Hangman and Wordle.
</p>
<p>
We, the creators of WordFinder, are Third year B.tech students, developing this game as part of our minor project. In this game, hints are provided for the word to be guessed based on the number entered. Each number has a different word stored in it. The player's goal is to figure out the word within limited number of wrong guesses. Players have seven reattempt after which they are out of the game.
</p>
<p>
To guess the word, any alphabet is to be entered and if it matches with the letters of the word then the game continues without losing any attempts.
</p>
<p>
Now don't wait, trust your fate, start the game and guess the word  </td>
